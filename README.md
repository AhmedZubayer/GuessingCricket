#GuessingCricket
My very first game using only basic C++. 
"Source Code.cpp" is the C++ source code and "Guessing Cricket.exe" is the executable game file. 
If you just want to try the game, download and run the installer, "Guessing Cricket Setup.exe" or from the direct link: https://cutt.ly/guessingcricket
